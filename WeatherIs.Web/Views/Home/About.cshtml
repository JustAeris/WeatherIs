<h3>...this website</h3>
<p>
    This website was made in the goal of providing quick information about the currentweather and as an exercise to practice coding.
    It uses <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap's API</a> to provide the weather and <a href="https://ip-api.com">ip-api's API</a> to get the IP's geolocation.<br/>
    It is also fully open-source on <a href="https://github.com/JustAeris/WeatherIs">GitHub</a>! You can make suggestions, or even collaborate, there.<br/>
    Here are a few of my goals for this website:<br/>
    • Having a functional base ✔<br/>
    • Multilingual support<br/>
    • Forecast support<br/>
    • Mobile support<br/>
    • Dark theme support
